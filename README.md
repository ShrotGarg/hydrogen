# hydrogen
A hobby programming language that is being built using java. It's a complete language in which I am building the compiler, generating the assembly code, and even calling the terminal commands

To run the file, you must clone the repo, enter it and run:
`javac no.java`
`java no test.hydro`

At the moment, the programming language support variable functionaility with constants and returns the exit code. You define variables using var and follow java-like syntax with minimal changes.
