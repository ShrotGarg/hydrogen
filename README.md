# hydrogen
A hobby programming language that is being built using java. It's a complete language in which I am building the compiler, generating the assembly code, and even calling the terminal commands

To run the file, you must clone the repo, enter it and run:
'javac no.java'
'java no ./test.hydro'

This will return an exit code of whatever you have placed inside test.hydro
